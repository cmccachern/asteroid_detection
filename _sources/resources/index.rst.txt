Algorithms
----------

`NEARBY Platform - Algorithm for Automated Asteroids Detection in Astronomical Images <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gLCzg12WGUcnZN4PAshGsWTPBqrfM5Kl/view?usp=sharing>`_:
This paper describes a pipeline for asteroid detection which strings together several other software packages to 
accomplish the job.  These external libraries include IRAF, SEXTRACTOR, SCAMP, and SWARP.  The algorithm is descibed at 
a high level.
The references in this paper may also be helpful in finding more information on asteroid detection algorithms.
